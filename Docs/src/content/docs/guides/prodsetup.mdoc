This guide details how to set up a modified version of Mercury Core for production hosting.

For a guide on setting up Mercury Core for local development, see [TODO].

## Requirements

You should already have the necessary dependencies and command line tools installed. If not, see [TODO] for an installation guid.

You will need:

-   A correctly configured or modified version of Mercury Core 
-   Latest version of [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed (expected as `bun`)
-   Latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed (expected as `docker`, optional)
    -   Alternative container managers can be used, for example [Podman](https://podman.io/).
-   Latest version of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) installed (expected as `caddy`)
-   A terminal
-   A modern web browser (Early 2024 onwards for most major browsers)
-   A computer, as it would be painful to live without one, wouldn't it?

## Instructions

{% steps %}

1. Copy the modified version of Mercury Core to your server.

2. Navigate to the **Site** directory.

3. Run `caddy start` to start the Caddy reverse proxy server.
    -   You can also run `caddy reload` to reload the configuration file without restarting the server.
    -   If you're using Caddy with multiple configuration files, import the Caddyfile in the repository's root directory into a Caddyfile somewhere else, and run `caddy start` and `caddy reload` from there.

4. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the database and economy service.

5. Copy the **Site/.env.example** file to **Site/.env** and modify it to set up the environment variables.

6. Run `bun prod` to install dependencies and begin building.

7. Run `bun ./build` (not to be confused with `bun build`) to start Mercury Core.

		Several methods can be used to run Mercury Core as a background process as well. Daemons, GNU Screen, containers, and PM2 all work for this purpose.
