[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is the most popular container management tool.

For a graphical interface, you can install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). For a command line only experience, install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

After installation, Docker should be available from the command line with `docker`.

## Virtualisation

Docker requires a virtualisation system to be enabled on your machine to run. This usually means enabling virtualization in your motherboard's UEFI/BIOS settings. Depending on your CPU, this may be called VT-x (Intel) or SVM (AMD), or something else, sometimes found under advanced CPU or security settings.
