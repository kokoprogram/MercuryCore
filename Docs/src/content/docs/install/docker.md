[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is the most popular container management tool.

For a graphical interface, you can install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). For a command line only experience, install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

After installation, Docker should be available from the command line with `docker`.
