[Go](https://go.dev) is a programming language and toolchain for building and managing software. It is used for parts of certain Mercury Core services. At the time of writing, the latest version is **v1.25.1**.

To install, download the latest [binary release](https://go.dev/dl/) and follow the installation instructions. Alternatively, it may be possible to install Go using a package manager of your choice.

## Upgrading

To upgrade Go to the latest version without going through the reinstallation process, update the **go.mod** file in the project's directory and change the Go version:

```
module whatever

go 1.25.1
```

Upon the next build or run command, Go will automatically download and use the specified version. If you're using a package manager, refer to its documentation for upgrade instructions.
