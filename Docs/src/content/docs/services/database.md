description: Details on the database design and how the service is used in Mercury Core.
---

This page provides information about the database used in Mercury Core, including its design, structure, and how it integrates with other services.

Mercury Core uses [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com) as its primary database solution. 

## Startup

The following command can be used to start an instance of SurrealDB, assuming it's ran in the root directory of the Mercury Core repository.

```bash
surreal start -u=root -p=root surrealkv://data/surreal
```

This should produce output similar to the following:

```log
 .d8888b.                                             888 8888888b.  888888b.

```

Omitting the `surrealkv://data/surreal` path argument will cause SurrealDB to use an in-memory database, which is useful for testing purposes. You may see a warning about the root user account already existing; which is normal if you have started the database before.

## Database inspection

A database management tool is available through the [Surrealist](https://app.surrealdb.com/) web interface, which can also be installed and run locally.

## Common issues

### Connection problems

SurrealDB supports connections via both HTTP (http://, https://) and WebSocket (ws://, wss://) protocols. Using the insecure versions should be fine if the service is running in local development or connected to from the Site hosted on the same machine, but if connecting remotely (such as to remotely manage the database on a VPS), the secure versions should be used. Add a domain configuration to the Caddyfile and change the default password to allow for this.

The WebSocket versions of the connection are broadly recommended over the HTTP versions, as they provide improved reliability and don't require re-authentication every 1 hour after connecting. If your connection seems to drop after being open for a long time (>1 hour), it may be over HTTP..

### Filesystem permissions

In some cases, the database may fail to start due to filesystem permission issues. This can occur if the user running the Mercury Core service does not have the necessary permissions to read or write to the database files.

An example of potential output could be as follows:

```log
